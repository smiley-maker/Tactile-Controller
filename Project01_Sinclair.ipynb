This method will propogate the value present in the last row into the one that is missing. The reason I chose to use a forward fill rather than something like the column average is because of the nature of the data I collected. Each class label has very different feature values and taking the mean of the whole column to fill a missing value would throw the data off by putting, for example, a large number into an area with smaller values. Thus, I decided that carrying the same value from the previous row would be a reasonable approach. "

Additionally, the accelerometer x and y components are the next most important; which also makes sense as they correspond to the linear motion of the sensor while rotating. Finally, both the Z coordinates for the accelerometer and gyroscope are the least important feature. This is reasonable because the four classes I decided to measure were not along the z axis. "

        "I started this experiment by creating my own dataset using an Arduino Uno and MPU-6050 accelerometer and gyroscope. I had a lot of fun learning how to gather data from Arduino into Excel and am really excited to come up with more machine learning implementations with Arduino and other microcontrollers. After collecting the data, I went on to preprocess it using various techniques. I started by resolving the missing values in the dataset by removing those containing fewer than three real values and using pandas 'fillna' method with a forward fill to impute the rest. This resulted in a fairly well balanced dataset. I then went on to map the categorical class labels to integer values. Next, I split the data into training and test sets, where the test set contained 35% of the original. I then standardized the test and training datasets using the Standard Scaler. Finally, the best features were chosen using a Random Forest and Select From Model method. The most meaningful features turned out to be the x coordinate of the gyroscope, and the x and y coordinates of the accelerometer. This lineup was consistant with the physical positions I chose.\n",

        "I decided to compare the Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine models. I thought that the SVM algorithm would perform the best of the three, which turned out to be true for both the testing and training data. I was also, however, hopnig that that the accuracy of each model would be a bit higher. The accuracies of the algorithms with the training data were centered around 85% and those for the test set were closer to 80%. While these are acceptable results, I was hoping to see outcomes closer to 90% or 95%. The SVM model performed the best at about 86% accuracy for the training dataset and around 82% for the test set. \n",

        "I learned a lot throughout this process. I feel like I gained a much deeper understanding of how the different techniques and algorithms we have covered so far work together to train and implement applicable models. I also learned more about the ethics of machine learning. Even though I didn't collect data from outside sources, I did use a microcontroller. To be honest, I hadn't given much thought to the fact that Arduino might have its own Terms of Service (TOS) before starting this project. I am glad that I was able to establish the best, and most ethical, means to collect my data. I plan to further my ideas using and to continue working with other microcontrollers in the future and I think that it is incredibly important to consider the ethical implications as well as the regulations in place when doing so. I really enjoyed working on this project. It was really exciting to dive into collecting data with sensors and to implement machine learning for my own application! I plan to eventually use what I have learned through this project in order to actually implement my Tacticle Color Controller. "
